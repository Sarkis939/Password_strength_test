# Password_strength_test
This site checks how strong your password actually is based on length, numbers, symbols, and character variety. No fake hype, just facts. If your password is Awful, don’t use it. Seriously. It’s basically an open door. If it’s Weak, it won’t last long eithereasy to crack with basic tools. Strong means you’re doing things right: decent length, good mix, solid protection. Very Strong is top tier. Hard to guess, hard to brute-force, and actually respectable. The goal is simple: stop people from getting into stuff they shouldn’t. If your password scores low, change it. If it scores high, respect you’re not clueless.
